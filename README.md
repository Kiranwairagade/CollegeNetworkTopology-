### College Network Topology Simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project simulates a network topology for a college campus using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The topology includes different departments, a central server room, and internet connectivity. The network is designed to ensure seamless communication across departments with efficient data routing and security measures.

Key features:
- **VLAN configuration** for segregating department traffic.
- **Static and dynamic routing protocols** (e.g., RIP, OSPF) for optimized data flow.
- **DNS and DHCP servers** for automated IP addressing and name resolution.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to enhance network security.
- **Wireless connectivity** setup for campus-wide internet access.
